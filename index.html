<h3>Shedding Light on Interaction Binaries: Radiation Hydrodynamics with Octo-Tiger</h3>
Speaker: Dominic Marcello<br>
Center for Computation & Technology<br>
Louisiana State University<br><br>

Abstract:
<p>
Octo-TIGER is an adaptive, octree-based code for modeling self-gravitating hydrodynamics in interacting binaries. We have extended Octo-TIGER to include gray radiation transport via the M1 moment method, coupling radiation energy and flux to the existing PPM hydrodynamics and FMM gravity solvers within a task-based HPX framework. Radiation variables are discretized on the same AMR mesh and evolved using an implicit-explicit scheme to handle both optically thick and thin regimes while conserving total energy and radiative flux. We validate the RHD module with standard radiation test problems, including a planar radiation front propagating through uniform media, radiative equilibration in matter–radiation coupling tests, and diffusion of a Gaussian radiation pulse. These benchmarks confirm the accuracy and efficiency of the M1 implementation in Octo-TIGER, laying the groundwork for forthcoming production runs of interacting binaries with full radiation feedback.

<h3>Chapel's Batteries-Included Approach for Portable Parallel Programming</h3>

Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE)<br><br>

Abstract:
<p>
Virtually all modern processors, including GPUs, from the consumer-grade to the highest-end are parallel. However, none of the mainstream programming languages support different flavors of hardware parallelism as a first-class concept. Capability to exploit parallelism in the hardware is typically achieved by augmenting inherently sequential programming languages like C, C++, or Fortran with add-ons like OpenMP, MPI, CUDA, OpenCL, or Kokkos.<br><br>
Chapel stands out as a programming language designed with parallelism and locality as first-class concepts in the programming language itself. That, and other modern programming features, have enabled Chapel users to overcome the barriers to parallel programming and HPC. In this talk, I will go over how parallelism and locality are expressed in Chapel, and how they can be used to target GPUs in a vendor-neutral manner. I will also refer to several success stories from the Chapel community.

<h3>Scaling AI for Scientific Discovery: Faster Kernels, Efficient Models, Better Physics</h3>
Speaker: Aparna Chandramowlishwaran <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aparna-chandramowlishwaran-302153b/"><i class="fa fa-linkedin-square" style="font-size:18px"></i></a> <br>
University of California, Irvine<br><br>

Abstract:
<p>
As AI becomes a powerful tool in scientific computing, two challenges emerge: (1) efficiently scaling models on modern hardware, and (2) ensuring these models can learn complex physics with fidelity and generalizability. In this talk, I will discuss our work at this intersection.
First, I will introduce Fused3S, a GPU-optimized algorithm for sparse attention—the backbone of graph neural networks and transformers. By fusing matrix operations, Fused3S reduces data movement and maximizes tensor core utilization, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse workloads. Then, I will present BubbleML and Bubbleformer, our efforts to model boiling dynamics with ML. Boiling is fundamental to energy, aerospace, and nuclear applications, yet remains difficult to model due to the interplay of turbulence, phase change, and nucleation. By combining large-scale simulation datasets with transformer architectures, Bubbleformer forecasts boiling dynamics across fluids, geometries, and operating conditions. Together, these efforts illustrate how scaling AI—both computationally and scientifically—can accelerate discovery across disciplines. I will conclude with open challenges and opportunities in AI-driven scientific computing, from hardware-aware models to foundation models for physics.

Abstract:
<p>
Spack makes it easy to install dependencies for our software on multiple HPC platforms. However, there is little guidance on how to structure Spack environments for larger projects, share common Spack installations with code teams and utilize them in an effective way for continuous integration and development. This presentation will share some of the lessons learned from deploying chained Spack installations for multiple code teams at LANL on various HPC platforms both on site and on other Tri-Lab systems, how to structure such deployments for reusability and upgradability, and make them deployable even on air-gapped systems. It will also show how we utilize Spack's build facilities to drive CMake-based projects on GitLab for continuous integration, without having to replicate build configuration logic in GitLab files, while giving developers an easy-to-follow workflow for recreating CI runs in various configurations.

Pacific Northwest National Laboratory<br>
Senior computer scientist<br><br>

Abstract:
<p>
In the realm of High-Performance Computing (HPC), achieving peak system performance while maintaining code safety and concurrency has always been a challenging endeavor. Traditional HPC frameworks often struggle with memory safety issues, race conditions, and the complexities of parallel programming. In this talk, I introduce Lamellar, a new HPC runtime that leverages the modern programming language Rust to address these enduring challenges.
Rust, known for its powerful type system and memory safety guarantees without a garbage collector, is rapidly gaining traction within the systems programming community. However, its potential in the HPC domain is yet to be fully explored. The Lamellar runtime harnesses Rust's strengths, providing a robust, scalable, and safe environment for developing and executing high-performance applications.
This talk is designed for computational domain and computer scientists who are well-acquainted with HPC concepts but may be new to Rust. The talk will cover the following key topics:
<ol>
    <li>Introduction to Rust: An overview of Rust’s features and why it's suitable for HPC applications.</li>
    <li>Understanding the Lamellar Runtime: A deep dive into the architecture and core components of the Lamellar runtime and stack.</li>
    <li>Concurrency and Parallelism: How Rust’s concurrency model and Lamellar API’s ensure safe parallel execution, eliminating common pitfalls like data races.</li>
    <li>Performance Benchmarks: Comparative analysis showcasing the performance benefits of using Rust Lamellar Runtime in selected benchmarks.
    </li>
    <li>Getting Started: Resources, tools, and best practices for adopting Rust and Lamellar in your HPC projects.</li>
</ol>
Join me as we look into the future of HPC with Rust and the Lamellar Runtime.

<h3>The value proposition of the Julia language for DOE’s mission</h3>
Speaker: William Godoy <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/william-f-godoy-7326a351/"><i class="fa fa-linkedin-square"     style="font-size:18px"></i></a><br>

Senior computer scientist<br><br>

Abstract:
<p>
We present a summary of our research and community efforts exploring the Julia
language for the scientific mission of the US Department of Energy (DOE) at the
intersection of high-performance computing (HPC) and high-productivity. Powered by
the LLVM compiler infrastructure combined with a unifying ecosystem and friendly
scientific syntax, Julia attempts to lower cost of a “two-language and multiple
ecosystems” paradigm (e.g. Python+compiled language). Along with the Julia intro and
HPC hands-on tutorials, we present our efforts on: (i) building an accessible
performance portable CPU/GPU library: JACC.jl, (ii) the outcome of external venues
(SC BoFs, tutorials) and workshops at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), and (iii)
our research, best paper at SC23 WORKS, on the unifying value for using a single
front-end language on Frontier, the second fastest supercomputer in the world, and (iv)
our work, best paper at SC24 XLOOP, connecting ORNL’s experimental and
computational facilities using JACC.jl. Hence, Julia aspires to make more accessible the
future landscape of heterogeneous, AI-driven, and energy-aware computing by
leveraging existing investments outside DOE in LLVM and commercial applications of
the language.

<h3>Transparent Resource Adaptivity for Task-Based Applications on Supercomputers</h3>
Speaker: Jonas Posner <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonas-posner-086381149/"><i class="fa fa-linkedin-square"     style="font-size:18px"></i></a><br>
University of Kassel, Germany<br>
Substitute Chair - Software Engineering<br><br>

Abstract:
<p>
Traditional static resource allocation in supercomputers (jobs retain a fixed set of resources) leads to inefficiencies. Resource adaptivity (jobs can change resources at runtime) significantly increases supercomputer efficiency.<br>
This talk will exploit Asynchronous Many-Task (AMT) programming, which is well suited for adaptivity due to its transparent resource management. An AMT runtime system dynamically assigns user-defined small tasks to workers to achieve load balancing and adapt to resource changes.<br>
We will discuss techniques for malleability and evolving capabilities that allow programs to dynamically change resources without interrupting computation. Automatic load detection heuristics determine when to start or terminate processes, which is particularly beneficial for unpredictable workloads. Practicality is demonstrated by adapting the GLB library. A generic communication interface allows interaction between programs and resource managers. Evaluations with a prototype resource manager show significant improvements in batch makespan, node utilization, and job turnaround time for both malleable and evolving jobs.

Jonas' research interests include load balancing, fault tolerance, and resource adaptivity for Asynchronous Many-Task (AMT) systems. Recently, he has focused on resource adaptivity in general to optimize the efficient use of supercomputing resources. His work covers a broad spectrum, including the development of advanced job scheduling algorithms, the improvement of application programming using AMT systems, and the interaction between resource managers and jobs.

<h3>Rust and type safety for MPI and scientific computing</h3>
Speaker: Jed Brown <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jed-brown-78295421/"><i class="fa fa-linkedin-square"         style="font-size:18px"></i></a><br>

Associate Professor of Computer Science<br><br>

Abstract:
<p>
Rust is a modern language that provides type- and memory-safety without a garbage collector, using a concept called lifetimes. Many see Rust as a successor to languages like C and C++, and there are many interested individuals in the computational science community, yet few major projects have made the switch. I'll introduce the language and its ecosystem, including the state of scientific computing libraries. We'll discuss what soundness means for libraries and examine rsmpi, which safely exposes MPI and allows catching many common bugs at compile-time. We'll also discuss type-system approaches to collective semantics, and conclude with an outlook on Rust for scientific computing.

<h3>Thermonuclear electron-capture supernovae - Motivating a long-overdue update to the supernova modeling pipeline for the exascale computing age</h3>
Speaker: Alexander Holas<br>
Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies<br><br>

Abstract:
<p>
The thermonuclear supernova modeling pipeline has been refined for over four decades and has achieved substantial success in modeling various supernova subtypes. Nonetheless, continuous innovation is essential for maintaining supernova modeling at the forefront of computational astrophysics. In this work, we examine a novel scenario, so called thermonuclear electron-capture supernovae. Originally proposed by Jones et al. (2016), this scenario consists of a collapsing sAGB star that only narrowly escape collapse to a neutron star by runaway thermonuclear thermonuclear burning. Here, we explore the specific circumstances under which such a thermonuclear explosion can occur and under which conditions the collapse can be averted by nuclear burning. Subsequently, we leverage this scenario to motivate a long-overdue update to the thermonuclear supernova modeling pipeline, both by increasing the complexity of the physics included, as well as updating the underlying codebase for the latest exascale computing clusters. In particular, we advocate the integration of radiation hydrodynamics and the transition towards a performance portable programming model.

<h3>Asynchronous-Many-Task Systems: Challenges and Opportunities - Scaling an AMR Astrophysics Code on Exascale machines using Kokkos and HPX</h3>

Abstract:
<p>
Dynamic and adaptive mesh refinement is pivotal in high-resolution,
multi-physics simulations, necessitating precise physics resolution in
localized areas across expansive domains. Today's supercomputers'
extreme heterogeneity and large number of compute nodes present a
significant challenge for such dynamically adaptive codes, highlighting
the importance of both scalability and performance portability. Our
research focuses on how to address this by integrating the asynchronous,
many-task runtime system HPX with the performance-portability framework
Kokkos and SIMD types. To demonstrate and benchmark our solutions at
scale, we incorporated them into Octo-Tiger, an adaptive, massively
parallel application for the simulation of binary star systems and their
outcomes. Thanks to this, Octo-Tiger now supports a diverse set of
processors, accelerators, as well as network backends and can scale on
various supercomputers, such as Perlmutter, Frontier, and Fugaku. In
this talk, we outline our various integrations between HPX and Kokkos.
Furthermore, we show the challenges we encountered when using these
frameworks together in Octo-Tiger and how we addressed them, ultimately
achieving scalability on a selection of current supercomputers.

<h3>Journal of Open Source Software: bot-assisted open peer review and publication</h3>

Speaker: Kyle Niemeyer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyleniemeyer/"><i class="fa fa-linkedin-square"                 style="font-size:18px"></i></a><br>

Associate Professor<br><br>

Abstract:
<p>
The Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS) is an open-access, no-fee scholarly journal that publishes quality open-source research software based on open peer review. JOSS was founded in 2016 with the dual objectives of giving traditional academic publication credit for software work and improving the quality of research software. Since its founding, JOSS has published over 2500 software papers—and counting!—with over 80 active editors spread across seven topic-area tracks. To handle this level of submissions and publishing, relying on a fully volunteer team, JOSS relies on GitHub and a system of open tools for reviewing and publishing submissions, driven by chatbot commands. Authors submit short Markdown papers along with links to their software's repository, which are compiled to PDF via Pandoc. JOSS’s editorial bot performs automated health checks on submissions, and reviews take place in GitHub issues, with authors, editors, and reviewers issuing bot commands via comments. This talk will describe the publication experience of JOSS and its machinery, and how it can be adapted by other communities.

Abstract:
<p>
The Message Passing Interface standard has long been the lingua franca of HPC. Its design has enabled the development of many distributed parallel applications. After 30 years, the field of high-performance computing has seen several programming paradigms come and go. However, MPI has yet to address the challenges of accelerator-based computing, the advent of modern languages such as Rust, Python, and C++, and fully asynchronous programming models. This talk will provide insights into current efforts on modernizing MPI, from accelerator integration to improved datatype handling for modern languages.
