<h1>Advances in Applied Computer Science Invited Speaker Series</h1>

In applied computer science new programming languages and paradigms, like Rust and Julia, new architectures, like Arm and RISC-V, and new GPU’s, like NVidia’s Grace Hopper, AMD's MI300A or Intel Max, are emerging. To keep on top of these advances, the Advances in Applied Computer Science series will invite speakers from academia, industry, and national labs. This will allow researchers and code developers to learn about these new tools and technologies and integrate them into codes to prepare them for future hardware and software.

<h2>Journal of Open Source Software: bot-assisted open peer review and publication</h2>

Speaker: Kyle Niemeyer<br>

School of Mechanical, Industrial, and Manufacturing Engineering<br>
Associate Professor<br><br>

Abstract:
<p>
The Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS) is an open-access, no-fee scholarly journal that publishes quality open-source research software based on open peer review. JOSS was founded in 2016 with the dual objectives of giving traditional academic publication credit for software work and improving the quality of research software. Since its founding, JOSS has published over 2500 software papers—and counting!—with over 80 active editors spread across seven topic-area tracks. To handle this level of submissions and publishing, relying on a fully volunteer team, JOSS relies on GitHub and a system of open tools for reviewing and publishing submissions, driven by chatbot commands. Authors submit short Markdown papers along with links to their software's repository, which are compiled to PDF via Pandoc. JOSS’s editorial bot performs automated health checks on submissions, and reviews take place in GitHub issues, with authors, editors, and reviewers issuing bot commands via comments. This talk will describe the publication experience of JOSS and its machinery, and how it can be adapted by other communities.

<h2>Improving MPI Interoperability for Modern Languages and Systems</h2>

Speaker: Joseph Schuchart<br>
Stony Brook University<br>
Institute for Advanced Computational Science<br>
Senior Research Scientist<br><br>

Abstract:
<p>
The Message Passing Interface standard has long been the lingua franca of HPC. Its design has enabled the development of many distributed parallel applications. After 30 years, the field of high-performance computing has seen several programming paradigms come and go. However, MPI has yet to address the challenges of accelerator-based computing, the advent of modern languages such as Rust, Python, and C++, and fully asynchronous programming models. This talk will provide insights into current efforts on modernizing MPI, from accelerator integration to improved datatype handling for modern languages.

Bio:
<p>
Joseph Schuchart is a Senior Research Scientist at the Institute for Advanced Computational Sciences at Stony Brook University. His research revolves around distributed asynchronous and task-based programming models, communication libraries, and design aspects of integrating different models. Joseph received his M.Sc. in Computer Science from Dresden University of Technology in 2012 and his PhD from the University of Stuttgart in 2020. He is an active member of the MPI Forum and a contributor to the Open MPI project.
