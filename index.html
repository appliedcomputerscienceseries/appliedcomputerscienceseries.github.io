<h1>Advances in Applied Computer Science Invited Speaker Series</h1>

In applied computer science new programming languages and paradigms, like Rust and Julia, new architectures, like Arm and RISC-V, and new GPU’s, like NVidia’s Grace Hopper, AMD's MI300A or Intel Max, are emerging. To keep on top of these advances, the Advances in Applied Computer Science series will invite speakers from academia, industry, and national labs. This will allow researchers and code developers to learn about these new tools and technologies and integrate them into codes to prepare them for future hardware and software.

<h2>Thermonuclear electron-capture supernovae - Motivating a long-overdue update to the supernova modeling pipeline for the exascale computing age</h2>
Speaker: Alexander Holas<br>

Abstract:
<p>
The thermonuclear supernova modeling pipeline has been refined for over four decades and has achieved substantial success in modeling various supernova subtypes. Nonetheless, continuous innovation is essential for maintaining supernova modeling at the forefront of computational astrophysics. In this work, we examine a novel scenario, so called thermonuclear electron-capture supernovae. Originally proposed by Jones et al. (2016), this scenario consists of a collapsing sAGB star that only narrowly escape collapse to a neutron star by runaway thermonuclear thermonuclear burning. Here, we explore the specific circumstances under which such a thermonuclear explosion can occur and under which conditions the collapse can be averted by nuclear burning. Subsequently, we leverage this scenario to motivate a long-overdue update to the thermonuclear supernova modeling pipeline, both by increasing the complexity of the physics included, as well as updating the underlying codebase for the latest exascale computing clusters. In particular, we advocate the integration of radiation hydrodynamics and the transition towards a performance portable programming model.

<h2>RISC-V HPC Terrain Familiarization</h2>

Speaker: Chris Taylor<br>
Tatical Computing Lab<br>
Principle Research Engineer<br><br>

Abstract:
<p>
The number of RISC-V commercial products increased substantially this past year. This presentation is an orientation to the range of RISC-V hardware, HPC software support, the community, and the current state of HPC-relevant ISA extensions. Acquiring RISC-V hardware is no longer a question of when - it is possible now.

<h2>Journal of Open Source Software: bot-assisted open peer review and publication</h2>

Speaker: Kyle Niemeyer<br>
Oregon State University<br>
School of Mechanical, Industrial, and Manufacturing Engineering<br>
Associate Professor<br><br>

Abstract:
<p>
The Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS) is an open-access, no-fee scholarly journal that publishes quality open-source research software based on open peer review. JOSS was founded in 2016 with the dual objectives of giving traditional academic publication credit for software work and improving the quality of research software. Since its founding, JOSS has published over 2500 software papers—and counting!—with over 80 active editors spread across seven topic-area tracks. To handle this level of submissions and publishing, relying on a fully volunteer team, JOSS relies on GitHub and a system of open tools for reviewing and publishing submissions, driven by chatbot commands. Authors submit short Markdown papers along with links to their software's repository, which are compiled to PDF via Pandoc. JOSS’s editorial bot performs automated health checks on submissions, and reviews take place in GitHub issues, with authors, editors, and reviewers issuing bot commands via comments. This talk will describe the publication experience of JOSS and its machinery, and how it can be adapted by other communities.

<h2>Improving MPI Interoperability for Modern Languages and Systems</h2>

Speaker: Joseph Schuchart<br>
Stony Brook University<br>
Institute for Advanced Computational Science<br>
Senior Research Scientist<br><br>

Abstract:
<p>
The Message Passing Interface standard has long been the lingua franca of HPC. Its design has enabled the development of many distributed parallel applications. After 30 years, the field of high-performance computing has seen several programming paradigms come and go. However, MPI has yet to address the challenges of accelerator-based computing, the advent of modern languages such as Rust, Python, and C++, and fully asynchronous programming models. This talk will provide insights into current efforts on modernizing MPI, from accelerator integration to improved datatype handling for modern languages.
