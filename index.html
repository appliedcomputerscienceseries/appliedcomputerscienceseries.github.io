<h2>Improving MPI Interoperability for Modern Languages and Systems</h2>

Abstract:
<p>
The Message Passing Interface standard has long been the lingua franca of HPC. Its design has enabled the development of many distributed parallel applications. After 30 years, the field of high-performance computing has seen several programming paradigms come and go. However, MPI has yet to address the challenges of accelerator-based computing, the advent of modern languages such as Rust, Python, and C++, and fully asynchronous programming models. This talk will provide insights into current efforts on modernizing MPI, from accelerator integration to improved datatype handling for modern languages.
